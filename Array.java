/* 
*   I go through all Java array aspects I can think of
*/

//Ways to start an array:

int[] numbers = {12, 15, 32, 12, 02, 33, 123, 445, 120, 32}; //Declare and add known value
String[] names; // I initiate an array but dont start it. 
String[] cars = new String[n] //n is the set length of the array.
boolean[][] xx = {{true, false, true}{false, true, false}}; // multi dim. array...

/* DEFAULT INITIAL VALUE=
*   numbers are 0, booleans are false and objects like Strings are null...
*/
